# ⚙️ Splinter

Splinter (Sequence Processing Language Interpreter) is a tree-walking
interpreter for the Restricted Access Sequence Processing language.

## 🚧 Project Status

RVMZ is a work-in-progress project. For now, it builds an AST for the program,
which then gets evaluated by the tree-walking interpreter.
+ The next stage would be replacing the tree-walking interperter with a
  register-based virtual machine to gain speed.
+ The last stage is fully dedicated to wrtiting down the specification.
